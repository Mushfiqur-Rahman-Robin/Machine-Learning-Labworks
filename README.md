This are some of the lab works of my machine learning (CSE-464) course. This is an academic course of my university. I learnt to implement several machine learning algorithms, and also gained an understanding of how ML algorithms work. This course also taught us how a basic artificial neural network works. The dataset we used for this course comprises of the individual data about our mental health. The data ranges from our first to fourth year. It has many features like: 'Which year are you in?', 'How are you feeling right now?', 'Age', 'Your location ?','Relationship status', 'Are you happy with your financial state?', 'How much have you succeeded to cope up with the environment of your educational institution?', 'Understanding with your family members?','Are you feeling pressure in your study or work right now?', 'Are you satisfied with your academic result?','Are you happy with your living place?', 'Who supports you when you are not succeeding in your academic life?', 'Have you used any social media within the last 6 hours?', 'Do you have inferiority complex', 'Are you satisfied with your meal today?', 'Are you feeling sick/health issues today?', 'Have you done any recreational activity (sports, gaming, hobby etc.) today?', 'How long did you sleep last night?(in hours)'. I experimented every machine learning algorithms by tweaking the parameters. The best results were submitted as the final work.
